# vue-loader-boilerplate
I created this repository because I found myself repeating the same setup for multiple projects over and over again. The setup consists of vue-loader, with the addition of Bootstrap 4, node-sass, sass-loader, and Font Awesome 5. Adding these elements to vue-loader saves me about an hour of work.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```
